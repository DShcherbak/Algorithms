# Algorithms semester_3
My Labs for Algorithms classes in university, semester_3

Lab 1: Sorting with strict memory limit 

Lab 2: Relative sorting two arrays with only comparing between those

Lab 3: Making a sorting heap with D sons in each node

Lab 4: Sorting a bool array (or a complicated array with boolean sorting key)

        a) stable and for O(n)

        b) stable and with no additional memory
        
        c) for 0(n) time and O(1) additional memory
        
        Bonus: in function second_sort_cool I took advantage of the fact that 0 and 1 keys 
                were stored as "int" and overusing those
                came up with a sort, which is stable, takes O(n) time and O(1) additional memory

Lab 6: Simple implementation of Z-function

Lab 7: Rabin-Karp algorithm impoved to be used on Matrix
